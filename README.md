# WRITEME

> **This README was automatically generated by WRITEME itself, demonstrating the application's AI-powered documentation capabilities.**

## Project Description
WRITEME is a Spring Boot web application designed to help developers generate comprehensive README files for their projects. Users can upload their project files, and the application analyzes the codebase to create a well-structured README file by leveraging AI for enhanced documentation.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to build the web application.
- **Thymeleaf**: Templating engine for rendering HTML views.
- **Maven**: Dependency management tool.
- **AI Services**: For generating README content based on code analysis.

## Main Features
- **Project File Upload**: Users can easily upload their project files through a user-friendly interface.
- **Codebase Analysis**: The application analyzes the uploaded codebase to extract relevant information for the README.
- **AI-Generated README**: Utilizes AI capabilities to create a detailed README file based on the analysis.
- **RESTful API Integration**: Provides endpoints for interaction with the application.

## How to Run/Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seansjlee/writeme.git
   cd writeme
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Maven installed, then run:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Spring Boot application using:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application.

## API Endpoints
### DocumentationController
- **GET `/`**: Displays the main upload page where users can submit their project files.

### DocumentationService
- **Additional functionalities** for processing uploaded files and interacting with the AI service to generate the README.

### AiService
- **Method**: `generateReadmeFromAi()`
    - This method interacts with the AI service to generate a README based on the code analysis.
