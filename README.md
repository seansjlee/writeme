# WRITEME

> **This README was automatically generated by WRITEME itself, demonstrating the application's AI-powered documentation capabilities.**

## Project Description
WRITEME is a Spring Boot web application designed to assist developers by generating comprehensive README files for their Java projects. By uploading project files, WRITEME analyzes the codebase and formulates prompts that are sent to Spring AI, utilizing an OpenAI model to generate informative documentation. This tool streamlines the process of creating essential project documentation, saving time and enhancing clarity. Future plans include support for additional programming languages.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the web application.
- **OpenAI API**: Utilized for generating README content based on code analysis.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for deploying the application.
- **Thymeleaf**: Used as the templating engine for rendering HTML views.
